export const FAQS = [
  {q:"What is life insurance?", a:`A contract that pays your beneficiaries when you pass away. It protects income, debts, and goals. Start with a needs estimate, then compare quotes here: ${LINK.quote}.`},
  {q:"What is term life insurance?", a:`Coverage for a set period (e.g., 10–30 years). It’s the most affordable way to protect income during high‑need years. Get term quotes: ${LINK.quote}.`},

  {q:"Do I need a medical exam?", a:`Not always. Many carriers offer no‑exam or accelerated underwriting if you qualify. We’ll try for simplified first: ${LINK.quote}.`},

  {q:"Suicide clause", a:`Typically excludes suicide in the first 2 years (varies by state). After that period, claims are generally payable per policy terms.`},
  {q:"Grace period", a:`Time after a missed premium to pay and keep coverage active (often ~30 days). Don’t let it lapse—set autopay.`},
