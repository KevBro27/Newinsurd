### Solutions Page (SolutionsPage.tsx) ###
Title: The Right Tool for Your Legacy
Subtitle: Different goals require different strategies. Explore the solutions we offer to find the right fit for your family's needs.
Insurance Types:
1. Term Life Insurance (The Affordable Shield): Think of it like renting protection. It provides the maximum amount of coverage for the lowest cost, for a specific period of time (e.g., 20 or 30 years). It's simple and incredibly effective. Perfect For: New parents protecting a mortgage, families wanting to replace income on a budget, or covering any large, temporary financial responsibility.
2. Whole Life Insurance (The Permanent Legacy): Think of it like owning your protection. It's permanent coverage that lasts your entire life, never expires, and includes a savings component (cash value) that grows over time, tax-deferred. Perfect For: Estate planning, leaving a guaranteed inheritance, or for individuals seeking lifelong coverage with a built-in financial asset.
3. Final Expense (The Final Gift of Love): A simplified type of whole life policy with a smaller death benefit, designed specifically to cover end-of-life costs like funeral expenses, medical bills, and small debts. Perfect For: Seniors and individuals who want to ensure their final expenses don't become a burden on their loved ones. Often features easy or no-questions-asked qualification.
4. Universal Life (IUL) (The Flexible Asset): A flexible type of permanent insurance. Think of it like a financial Swiss Army knife. It offers lifelong protection but with adjustable premiums and a cash value component often tied to a stock market index, offering higher growth potential. Perfect For: Savvy investors looking to maximize tax-advantaged growth, high-net-worth individuals, or those wanting flexible premium options with their permanent coverage.

### Founder Profile Page (FounderProfilePage.tsx) ###
Title: Meet the Founder
Subtitle: My journey from Registered Behavior Technician to insurance strategist was driven by one simple belief: families deserve a plan built on trust, not pressure.
My Story: My journey isn't a typical one. It was forged by a challenge most people never have to face: Sickle Cell Disease. Going through pain crises and blood transfusions can be overwhelming for anyone, especially a child. But from a young age, I learned a critical lesson: you either let your circumstances define you, or you build a strategy to defy them. I chose to defy them. I did the things the doctors told me not to. I played basketball. I drank soda. My mindset was simple: I was going to live life on my own terms, and nothing was going to stop me. As I got older, the hospital visits became less frequent. My mission became clear: I wanted to help people navigate their own challenges. This led me to become a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT), where my job was to build strategies for children with autism, helping them fight through their own battles. Seeing the sincere appreciation on their parents' faces when a plan came together meant the world to me. I was living my dream—I was healthy, I had a career I loved, and I was driving a pretty sweet car, a white Dodge Challenger GT. Then, at 30, the fight came back harder. A severe Sickle Cell crisis led to a stroke—or multiple strokes—and a month-long coma. I spent another month in rehab, learning how to walk and talk again. There were days I wanted to give up. But then I was reminded of the kids I worked with. I couldn't demand they fight their battles if I wasn't willing to fight my own. It took tears and a relentless fight, but I got back on my feet. But while I was fighting for my health, my finances collapsed. My bank account hit zero. The car I'd worked so hard for was repossessed. I even had hiring managers tell me they loved my RBT resume but wouldn't hire me because of my health issues. I was in a downward spiral. Scrolling the internet, I saw an opportunity to study for a life insurance license. A bell went off in my head. This is it. This is how I go back and help people. I cut off social media and dedicated myself to studying. I earned my license and got a lot of attention from different insurance companies, but I quickly realized their playbook was wrong. It was about sales quotas, not solutions. They weren't equipped to help people avoid the exact financial catastrophe I had just survived. So I started on the journey to create this platform. Not to be another overbearing or pushy agent, but to be a strategic disruptor. My mission is to use my story—the fight, the collapse, and the comeback—to arm people with a real plan, so they can protect their life and build their legacy with confidence.

### All Articles ###
Article 1 (nj-insurance-mistake): The #1 mistake is relying solely on your employer's group life insurance. It's not yours (you lose it when you leave the job), it's rarely enough coverage (1-2x salary), and it creates a false sense of security. The solution is to own a private policy you control.

Article 2 (legacy-blueprint): Life insurance should be treated as a financial asset, not an expense. Permanent policies have cash value that grows tax-deferred and can be accessed tax-free via loans. This provides stability and is an efficient way to transfer wealth income-tax-free.

Article 3 (outdated-policies): Old whole life policies from past generations often have high fees, poor returns, and are inflexible. Modern policies like Indexed Universal Life (IUL) have lower costs, better growth potential tied to market indexes (with downside protection), and more flexibility. An audit can see if you can get a better deal.

Article 4 (one-page-audit): A 5-minute self-audit involves checking: 1. Beneficiary: Is it up to date? 2. Coverage Amount: Is it still enough (10-15x income)? 3. Policy Type: Do you know if it's Term or Whole Life and if Term is expiring? 4. Cost vs. Value: Are premiums high for the benefit and is cash value growing? If you find red flags, a professional audit is needed.

Article 5 (new-parent-playbook): New parents need maximum protection for minimum cost. The best tool is Term Life Insurance. A healthy 30-year-old can get a $1M, 30-year policy for around $50-$70/month, which can cover a mortgage, replace income, and fund college.

Article 6 (job-insurance-trap): Your job's life insurance is a trap because: 1. It's not portable (you lose it when you leave). 2. It's not enough coverage (usually 1-2x salary). 3. Supplemental "buy-up" coverage can be more expensive than a private policy. You should own your own policy.

Article 7 (financial-armor): Think of life insurance as "financial armor," not a "safety net." It's a proactive tool that empowers you to take smart risks, like starting a business or investing more aggressively, because your family's foundation is secure. Modern policies also have "living benefits" that let you access the death benefit if you have a critical, chronic, or terminal illness.

Article 8 (iul-swiss-army-knife): Indexed Universal Life (IUL) is a flexible permanent policy. Its cash value growth is tied to a stock market index (like S&P 500) but is protected from losses with a 0% floor. In exchange, there's a cap on the upside potential. It can be used for tax-free retirement income, offers flexible premiums, and provides lifelong protection.

Article 9 (nj-wealth-transfer): New Jersey has an inheritance tax. This can force heirs to sell assets to pay the tax bill. Life insurance provides an immediate, income-tax-free death benefit. By placing the policy in an Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT), the cash can be used to pay taxes, preserving the estate's other assets for your heirs.

Article 10 (montclair-case-study): A Montclair family was paying $250/month for a $250k whole life policy. This was too expensive and not enough coverage. An audit showed they could get a $1.5M, 30-year term policy for only $150/month. They increased their coverage 6x while saving $1,200 annually.

Article 11 (founder-story-mission): This is the founder's personal story, as detailed in the Founder Profile section. The mission is to be a strategic disruptor, not a pushy agent, helping people build a real plan to avoid financial catastrophe based on his own experiences with Sickle Cell disease and financial collapse.

Article 12 (quote-tool-advantage): The Quote & Apply tool gives users an advantage through: 1. Instant Market Access (scans dozens of carriers). 2. Total Anonymity & Control (no pressure from an agent). 3. Speed to Application (minutes, not weeks).

Article 13 (ethos-partnership-summary): The partnership with Ethos offers a 100% digital experience for clients who value speed and simplicity. Ethos uses technology to provide a final decision in minutes, often with no medical exam required.
